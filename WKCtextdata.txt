<b>CELL EDITING HELP</b>
<div style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:6px;">
(See also: <a href="" onclick="ajaxgetnamedtext_request('functionhelptext', 'helpbody');return false;">Function Help</a>)
</div>
To enter a new value in a cell, type on the keyboard.
For more extensive editing click in the typing area above.
If the cell contents starts with equal (=) it will be considered to be a formula,
with apostrophe (') it will be text, all numeric will be a numeric value,
and text otherwise for most other forms.
Numbers that start with "$" are treated as currency, those ending with "%" are scaled by 1/100
and treated as percent, and "number/number/number" is treated as a date.<br><br>
After typing, <b>pressing Enter</b> or clicking the OK button will save the new value and retrieve updated values from the server.
The <b>Escape</b> key cancels typing, and <b>backspace</b> should work as expected.
The <b>Delete</b> key by itself erases the contents of the cell.
<br><br>
There are various commands available (insert row, etc.), described below.
<br><br>
Cells with text preserve explicit line breaks and have other special formatting rules (see below).
<br><br>
<b>Clicking on a cell</b> in the spreadsheet or <b>pressing an arrow key</b> will move to that cell saving any changes made to the current cell.
When you are typing in a formula, pointing to another cell with the arrow keys or by clicking
will add that cell's address to the formula if it follows an operator (+-*/%, etc.).<br><br>
Formulas may use +, -, *, /, % (scale by .01), ^ (exponentiation), and parenthesis,
and the comparison operators &lt;, &lt=, =, &gt;=, &gt;, and <> (not equal).
Cell addresses are in the form of A1 and B22.
Cell addresses may have an optional sheet name, for example western!B40 to access the value of cell
B40 on the most recently published copy of page "western".
(To force a recalculation to get the latest values, use the /Global Recalculation Now command.)
Cell addresses may include $'s (e.g., $A$15) to control offsetting in copies.
Within formulas extra spaces around operators are ignored.
Within formulas you can have formula text values typed within quotes (e.g., "this is text").
Within a formula text value double quotes are replaced by single quotes.
<br><br>
<b>FUNCTIONS</b><br><br>
For a list of supported functions that may be used in formulas, see the
<a href="" onclick="ajaxgetnamedtext_request('functionhelptext', 'helpbody');return false;"><b>Function Help</b></a>.
<br><br>
<b>SCROLLING</b><br><br>
Use the special slider control on the right side of the sheet to scroll rows without moving the top of the screen.
The PageUp and PageDown keys also affect scrolling.
During certain operations scrolling is disabled.
When that happens, Esc can often be used to get back to a state where scrolling is allowed.
<br><br>
<b>TEXT FORMATTING</b><br><br>
To have a larger area for typing and to allow for multiple lines
press the "Multi-line edit" button.
<br><br>
Text in a cell is automatically formatted.
Explicit line breaks (pressing Enter) are preserved.
Text will be wrapped to fit cells depending upon column width settings
and merged cells.
Through explicit formats set with the Format tab text may be treated as plain text,
as wiki text, or as HTML text.
<br><br>
The following sequences have special effects in text that is treated as wiki text (the default format):
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>''text''<br>[i:text:i]<dd>Italic text (note the '' sequences are two apostrophes, not a quote).
If the ' is the first character of the cell it is treated as the "make this text" indicator,
not the beginning of italic or bold.
<dt>'''text'''<br>[b:text:b]<dd>Bold text (note the ''' sequences are three apostrophes)
<dt>{{amp}}, {{lt}}, {{gt}}, {{quot}}<br>{{lbracket}}, {{rbracket}}, {{lbrace}}<dd>&amp;,  &lt;,  &gt;, ", [, ], {
<dt>[quote:text:quote]<dd>Indented text
<dt>[http://rest-of-url text]<dd>Text linking to the URL.
Note the space separating the URL from the text.
<dt>[link:url text:link]<dd>Text linking to URL (url includes http:, mailto:, etc.)
<dt>[popup:url text:popup]<dd>Text linking to URL with target="_blank" to popup window
<dt>[image:url text:image]<dd>Image shown in-line with ALT text
<dt>[page:pagename text]<dd>Link to a page on this site.
Pagename is the short name of the page, with no ".html".
If "text" is missing the pagename will be used as the link text.
In multi-line editing the "Link to page" button lets you choose a page
from a list and automatically create this type of link and add it to the end of the text.
<dt>[cell:cell-coordinate]<dd>Inserts the characters that display in the cell formatted as specified in the cell,
for example [cell:B7].
</dl>
If a cell has more than one line (separated by pressing Enter in multi-line editing),
then lines starting with the following characters are treated as listed:
<dl>
<dt>=<dd>Heading level. May have 1-5 ='s and should have an equal number at the end of the line.
One or more spaces should follow the first set of ='s and precede the ending ones.
<dt>:<dd>Indent. May have 1-5 :'s to indent further and further.
<dt>*<dd>Bulleted list item. May have 1-5 *'s to have sublists.
<dt>#<dd>Numbered list item. May have 1-5 #'s to have sublists.
<dt>;<dd>Definition list item. The "term" follows it, followed by a ":" and then the definition.
May have 1-5 ;'s to have sublists.
</dl>
</div>
<br>
<b>COMMANDS</b><br><br>
There are some commands available while editing.
They may be accessed by clicking on buttons or by typing.
<br><br>
You can enter <b>multi-line editing</b> by either pressing the Multi-Line edit button
or by typing a quote (").
You can also start multi-line editing by clicking an additional time on a cell
that already contains multi-line content.
<br><br>
You can enter the <b>Range</b> commands by either pressing the Range button
or by typing a colon (:).
The Range commands have their own help text.
Range commands include: select a range of cells, Merge cells, Copy/Cut, Fill Right/Down, and Table (which has Sort).
<br><br>
You can enter <b>other commands</b> by pressing the More button or by typing a slash (/).
The More commands have their own help text.
The More commands include: Pasting, Inserting/Deleting rows and columns, and controlling automatic recalculation.
<br><br>
<b>EXTENDING THE SHEET</b>
<br><br>
Rows and columns that include all cells with data are displayed.
In addition 10 more rows are added at the bottom to make extending the sheet easier.
Those rows are not rendered when Previewing nor when Publishing.
<br><br>
There are buttons for Add Row and Add Column below the sheet display.
They add additional rows or columns to the bottom or right that will always be displayed.
You can also use the "More" commands to insert rows or columns in the middle of the sheet.
<br><br>

*** WKCtextdataname: rangehelptext ***
<b>RANGE COMMANDS HELP</b><br><br>
Ranges are a rectangular group of cells that you can apply commands to.
Ranges extend from the initial upper-left cell to the right and down to a bottom-right cell.
They may consist of cells in a single row, single column, or even a single cell.
The range is highlighted with a background color (that temporarily overrides the current
background color of a cell).
<br><br>
You can change the extent of a range by pressing the arrow keys or by clicking on a cell.
You can apply a command to the range by then clicking on a command button or typing an appropriate character.
The commands are as follows:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Merge Cells, Unmerge<dd>When cells are merged the contents of the upper-left cell of the range
will cover the other cells which will not be displayed.
This is the easiest way to have <b>wide lines of text across multiple columns</b>.
It can also be used to have a vertical narrow column that spans multiple lines.
Unmerging a merged cell sets things back to normal.
<dt>Copy<dd>Copies from the selected cells to the sheet's clipboard.
The contents of the cells and/or the formatting information is copied, as set by the radio buttons on the right.
Each page has its own clipboard.
Use the Load From Sheet command on the Tools tab to load the clipboard of this page from the
clipboard of another page.
<dt>X-Cut<dd>Copies to the clipboard like Copy, but then deletes what was copied.
<dt>Erase<dd>Deletes the contents and/or formatting information in the cells, as set by the radio buttons on the right.
<dt>Fill Right<dd>Copies the contents/formatting of the cells in the left-most column into the other columns in the same row.
Cell references in formulas are modified as appropriate.
<dt>Fill Down<dd>Copies the contents/formatting of the cells in the top-most row into the other rows in the same column.
Cell references in formulas are modified as appropriate.
<dt>Table<dd>There is only one table command: <b>Sort</b>. It is used to sort the rows in the range
based upon the values in specified columns.
</dl>
</div>
There are <b>keyboard short-cuts</b> for the commands.
They are listed on a prompt line above the buttons (e.g., C for copy, X for cut). Case is ignored.
There are additional commands there for deleting all of the rows or columns in the range.
<br><br>

*** WKCtextdataname: edittablehelptext ***
<b>TABLE COMMANDS HELP</b><br><br>
There is only one table command:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Sort<dd>Sort is used to sort the rows in the range based upon the values in specified columns.
Make sure that the entire range of cells you wish to sort are selected before choosing the Sort command.
</dl>
</div>

*** WKCtextdataname: edittablesorthelptext ***
<b>SORT COMMAND HELP</b><br><br>
The Sort command sorts the contents of the rows in the selected range based upon the values in specified columns.
Use the Major, Minor, and Last Sort settings to choose which columns to base the sort upon.
Only the Major Sort is required. The other columns are only checked when the Major Sort values are equal.
Use the Ascending and Descending radio buttons to indicate the direction of the sort for the specified column.
<br><br>
The sort orders considers numeric values less than text and text less than error values.
Blank cells go last no matter which way sort is done.
Text is sorted as if all alphabetic characters are lower case.
Currently only the 96 ASCII characters are sorted correctly.
<br><br>

*** WKCtextdataname: editmorehelptext ***
<b>EDIT "MORE COMMANDS" HELP</b><br><br>
The commands available are:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Range<dd>Switch to the Range commands.
This is an alternative way to get to the range commands.
It works especially well from the keyboard where you can just type "/R".
You can also type a colon (:) here to switch to the Range commands.
<dt>Paste All<dd>Copies the data from the cells on the sheet's clipboard to the
cells starting with the cursor position as the upper-left.
Each page has its own clipboard.
The contents of the cells and the formatting information are both copied overwriting what was in each cell.
This command is not available if the clipboard is empty.
<dt>Paste Contents<dd>The same as the Paste All command but only overwrites the contents of the cells, not the formatting.
<dt>Paste Formats<dd>The same as the Paste All command but only overwrites the formatting of the cells, not the contents.
Use this to <b>apply the formatting of one cell to other cells</b> by copying one or more cells and then doing Paste Formats.
<dt>Recalc Manual, Recalc Auto<dd>Turns on and off automatic recalculation.
With sheets that have many calculations, or that use functions that take a long time to access data from other websites,
turning off recalculation can save time during data entry.
When changes have been made to the sheet and recalculation is turned off an indication will
appear on the regular Edit display saying that recalculation may be needed and a "Recalc Once" button will appear.
You can force a recalculation using the keyboard with the "/GRN" command (Global Recalculation Now).
<dt>Insert Row, Insert Column<dd>Adds a new row or column before the one with the cursor.
Cell references in formulas are modified as appropriate.
Formats are copied from the row/column before the one that is inserted (if it exists).
<dt>Delete Row, Delete Column<dd>Deletes the row or column with the cursor.
Cell references in formulas are modified as appropriate.
</dl>
</div>
There are <b>keyboard short-cuts</b> for the commands.
They are listed on a prompt line above the buttons (e.g., R for range, I followed by R for insert row). Case is ignored.
There is an additional command for deleting the contents of the clipboard (/PE - it saves space in the data file).
The Recalculation commands are on the /Global sub-menu (/GRM and /GRA for manual and automatic,
and /GRN to force a recalculation right now).
As a keyboard shortcut, the /F command switches to the Format tab.
<br><br>

*** WKCtextdataname: formathelptext ***
<b>FORMATTING HELP</b><br><br>
The Format tab lets you set the format of one or more cells.
The format is made up of many independent settings.
You choose which setting you want to change by clicking the appropriate button in the top row.
The current values for the various attributes will be shown.
Make the changes that you want and then <b>press the Save Settings button</b>.
If you do not save the settings they will be ignored.<br><br>
You can change the cell you are working with by using the arrow keys or by clicking on a cell.<br><br>
To apply the setting to a range of cells click the Range button (or press the ":" key) and then indicate
the bottom-rightmost cell using the arrow keys or by clicking.
Pressing the Escape key returns to setting just one cell.
Only the current settings of the first cell are shown in the attributes.<br><br>
<b>NUMBERS</b><br><br>
The numbers attributes are:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Alignment<dd>Numbers have separate alignment settings from plain text by default.
You can set the alignment for all types of content explicitly.
The setting applies to both numbers and text.
"Default" uses the All Cells number alignment default.
<dt>Format<dd>Sets the way numbers are displayed, controlling precision, thousands separators, etc.
A sample of different values formatted appropriately is shown when you make a selection.
Calculation is always done at full precision.
The built-in formats are grouped by type.
The Currency type has an additional setting to choose the currency symbol from a list.
The Special type includes "hidden" to hide the contents of a cell when published.
Custom formats may be set in a manner similar to many other spreadsheet programs
using the Custom format type.
(Note: In this program, day "1" is December 31, 1899 and the year 1900 is not a leap year.
Some programs use January 1, 1900, as day "1" and treat 1900 as a leap year.
In both cases, though, dates on or after March 1, 1900, are the same.)
<dt>All Cells<dd>This lets you edit the default values used for all cells that have no
setting or have the Default chosen.
If the default is left to a default value, then a common built-in setting is used, usually the General format.
</dl>
</div>
The General format for numbers is determined by the type of value being displayed.
Some numeric values are a special sub-type of number, such as date, date/time, etc.
The General format looks to that sub-type as a hint for how a value should be displayed.
You can override General by setting an explicit format for a cell.
<br><br>
Most formula operations look to the types and sub-types of values to determine the resulting type and sub-type.
For example, adding a plain number to a date results in a date,
while taking the trigonometric sine value of a date results in a number.
<br><br>
<b>TEXT</b><br><br>
The text attributes are:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Alignment<dd>Text cells have separate alignment settings from numbers by default.
You can set the alignment for all types of content explicitly.
The setting applies to both numbers and text.
"Default" uses the All Cells text alignment.
<dt>Format<dd>Sets the way text is displayed, be it plain text, wiki text, HTML, or other formats.
A sample of different values formatted appropriately is shown for some formats when you make a selection.
<dt>All Cells<dd>This lets you edit the default values used for all cells that have no
setting or have the Default chosen.
If the default is left to a default value, then a common built-in setting is used, usually the General format.
</dl>
</div>
The General format for text is determined by the type of value being displayed.
Depending upon the source of the text value, it may have a sub-type of text, such as HTML.
Text appearing by itself in a cell, not as the result of a formula, is treated as wiki text.
Most other text, such as text in a "quoted string" in a formula, is treated as plain text.
Some functions, such as wkcHTML, return text with a particular sub-type.
The General format looks to the sub-type as a hint for how a value should be displayed.
You can override General by setting an explicit format for a cell.
<br><br>
<b>FONTS</b><br><br>
The font attributes are:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Font Family<dd>This lets you choose the font family used for the cell
no matter what the content.
"Default" uses the All Cells font family.
<dt>Font Size<dd>This lets you specify the size for characters.
The first set uses browser relative sizes and the second set lets you set point size explicitly.
"Default" uses the All Cells font size.
<dt>Font Weight and Style<dd>Bold and/or italic, or the default.
<dt>All Cells<dd>This lets you edit the default values used for all cells that have no
setting or have the Default chosen.
If the default is left to a default value, then a common built-in setting is used.
</dl>
</div>
<b>COLORS</b><br><br>
The color attributes are:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Text Color<dd>This is the color of the characters.
Clicking on the color square pops up a color chooser.
You can choose one of the colors it proposes or click in the text box and type a hexadecimal RGB color value
(e.g., 000000 is black, FFFFFF is white, and 9999FF is light blue).
Clicking on the "Default" square uses the All Cells default value.
<dt>Background Color<dd>This works just like the Text Color but for the background of the cell.
<dt>All Cells<dd>This lets you edit the default values used for all cells that have no
setting or have the Default chosen.
If the default is left to a default value, then a common built-in setting is used.
</dl>
</div>
<b>BORDERS</b><br><br>
The border attributes can be set for all four sides of the cell or for each side individually.
In addition, if a range of cells has been selected you can choose to set just the edges
that bound the range of cells, not the edges between each cell.
There are no defaults for borders.
The border attributes are:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Visibility<dd>If checked the specified border(s) will be shown.
If unchecked they will not be shown.
<dt>Thickness<dd>The thickness of the border's line.
<dt>Style<dd>The type of line. Each brand of browser often handles these differently.
Only Solid is for certain.
<dt>Color<dd>The color of the line. Clicking this brings up a color chooser
like that for text color.
</dl>
</div>
<b>LAYOUT</b><br><br>
The layout attributes affect the positioning of characters within the cell.
The layout attributes are:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Cell Layout<dd>If "Use default" is selected, the default for all cells will apply to this cell.
If "Set explicitly" is selected, then the Alignment and Padding settings will apply.
<dt>Alignment<dd>The vertical alignment of the content within the cell if the cell is larger vertically than the content.
<dt>Padding<dd>The amount of padding between the cell border and the content, setable for each side independently.
<dt>All Cells<dd>This lets you edit the default values used for all cells that have no
setting or have "Use default" chosen.
If the default is set to "Use default", then a common built-in setting is used.
</dl>
</div>
<b>COLUMNS</b><br><br>
The column attributes are:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Width<dd>This is how wide the column will attempt to be.
Depending upon the content and browser window it may be different.
"Auto" tries to make it as wide as the content.
"Set" lets you set an explicit value in either pixels or percent.
When "Set" is checked a slider appears which you can drag on a scale to change the value.
"Default" uses the All Cells default value for the column width.
(All cells in a column have the same width.)
<dt>Visibility<dd>If checked the column will be hidden when Previewed or Published.
This lets you have comments or intermediate calculations that are not shown in the final result
but that are visible next time you edit.
<dt>All Cells<dd>This lets you edit the default used for all columns that have no
setting or have the Default chosen.
If the default is left to a default value, then a common built-in setting is used.
</dl>
</div>
<b>ROWS</b><br><br>
The row attribute is:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Visibility<dd>If checked the row will be hidden when Previewed or Published.
This lets you have comments or intermediate calculations that are not shown in the final result
but that are visible next time you edit.
</dl>
</div>
<b>MISC</b><br><br>
The miscellaneous attributes are:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Cell CSS Class<dd>When the page is Published this CSS style, if present, will replace the one
determined by the other settings, such as font family, font size, color, borders, etc.
This is an advanced feature and is designed to be used with a specific style sheet
associated with the published file.
This makes it easier to follow corporate and other standard "looks".
<dt>Cell CSS Style<dd>This text that will be added to a "style" attribute to the cell's "&lt;td>" tag.
For example, the value "color:red;padding:20px;" will make the text red and provide 20 pixels of padding
on each side within the cell.
This is an advanced feature that lets people who know HTML and CSS have further control of the look of the results.
This value, if present, is applied during editing, Previewing, and Publishing.
<dt>Live View Modifiable<dd>If checked, the cell may have a new value specified
in the URL that retrieves a Live View of the sheet, overriding the value
saved in the sheet for that view (the new value is not saved).
If not checked (the default), the cell's value may not be overridden.
This feature only affects Live View.
See the Publish tab help for more information about Live View.
</dl>
</div>
<br>

*** WKCtextdataname: previewhelptext ***
<b>PUBLISH HELP</b><br><br>
The Publish tab shows how the page will look without the cell grid shown but without the HTML template used when published.
To edit the page click on the Edit tab or click within a particular cell on the page.
To publish the page or view it as already published, click the appropriate button:
<br><br>
<b>PUBLISH</b><br><br>
The Publish button displays the URL of the page when published (if the site URL for HTML
in the site properties is set),
some publish options, and the currently set comments that will be associated with this page when
next published.<br><br>
The Options correspond to settings on the page Properties page (accessible through the Tools tab)
and may normally be ignored unless you need these features:
<div style="padding:1em 0 1em 20pt;">
If <b>Publish HTML</b> is checked, at publish time a copy of the current sheet
is converted to static HTML along with the specified template and stored in the
HTML directory for serving by a web server.
Leave this unchecked if you only want the page viewable using the live viewing facility.
<b>(See the description of Live Viewing below.)</b>
This is checked by default and publishing static HTML pages is the normal way to publish pages for many sites.
<br><br>
If <b>Publish Source</b> is checked, at publish time a copy of the page data file will be put
on the web in the same directory as the newly published HTML file (if requested),
but with the extension ".txt" instead of ".html".
That published data file may be copied when creating a new page
(using the Add New Page's "Copy from URL" option).
It may also be used to access the sheet from pages on other sites and other purposes.
For example, if cell E20 contained the URL of a page's source "http://www.domain.com/stats.txt",
then the reference "E20!B5" would access the value of cell B5 on that page when most recently published
and "sum(E20!C10:C20)" would add up the values in cells C10 through C20 on that page.
<br><br>
If <b>Publish Embeddable ".js" Version</b> is checked, at publish time a copy of the newly published
HTML will be saved (along with appropriate Javascript) in the HTML directory, but with the extension ".js" instead of ".html".
Only the HTML of the sheet itself is saved in this version, not the surrounding template.
This file may be dynamically included in any other HTML page on any web site by using HTML code such as:
<div style="padding:1em 0 1em 10pt;">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.domain.com/pagename.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</div>
The result is static and is not recalculated when accessed the way that it is with live viewing.
<br><br>
If <b>Allow Live View Without Login</b> is checked, viewing the page through the "live" interface
will be allowed even if the user is not logged in or is logged in as a user without
permission to access this site.
</div>
The Comments are used to save information about changes made to the page that might be useful to
editors in the future as well as current readers.
The comments are shown in the Backups list of previously published instances of a page as well
as in RSS feeds.
The comments may be edited here.
They may be saved without publishing by pressing the <b>Save Comments</b> button.
<br><br>
The <b>Publish and Continue</b> button saves the comments and then publishes the page.
The page remains open for editing, but the log of edits
(displayed as part of the Tools Backups Details display) is reset as if editing was started anew.
<br><br>
The <b>Publish and Close</b> button saves the comments and then publishes the page.
The page is closed for editing by this user for now, "checking it back in" so others may edit it.
<br><br>
Publishing a page normally renders the page as HTML wrapped in the template HTML specified in the page's properties.
A backup copy of the editable file is stored as specified by the Backup Preferences for the page's site
(set with the Tools Backups command).
A list of backup files may be displayed along with some of the information stored in them using the
Tools Backups command.
You can revert to a previous backup copy if you need to.
<br><br>
Publishing will also update the page and site RSS feed files if RSS is enabled for the site.
<br><br>
<b>VIEW ON WEB</b><br><br>
The View On Web button displays buttons that will bring up the most recently published version of the page in the browser window.
There is an option to display it in the current window or another, popup window.
<br><br>
You have the option of either seeing the page from the published static HTML
(this only works if the file exists and the site's URL for HTML has been set)
or as a Live View (this only works if the page has been published and
the site's URL for Editing has been set).
<br><br>
<b>LIVE VIEWING</b><br><br>
This is a feature through which you can have the most recently published
version of a page rendered for display upon request, usually after first doing a recalculation.
Unlike static HTML which the server just returns as it was created at
publish time, this "live" rendering is done by the server executing
this program to read the page source data file, doing the recalculation, and then converting
the results to HTML.
References to values on other pages, functions that return the current date/time, etc.,
can result in different results than at the time the page was last published.
<br><br>
You access a page for live viewing by accessing the URL For Editing with appropriate arguments.
The browser accessing the page must be logged in as a user with
read or read/write privileges to the page's site or the page must
have been published with Allow Live View Without Login checked.
<br><br>
The general form for requesting a live view page is something like:

There are five types of output that can be obtained through the live view functionality:
page (a normal HTML page, including the template HTML), html (just the HTML of the
sheet rendered as a table), js (Javascript to embed the HTML of the table within another page),
cdata (the table HTML as cdata within XML for use by Ajax, innerHTML, etc.), and source (the page source in
the same format it is produced by "Publish Source").
The "page" type is the default.
If not logged in and requesting type "page", a login page will be displayed.
Type "source" is only provided if "Publish Source" was checked for this page for the most recent publish.
<br><br>
You specify the type with a "type" argument:
<br><br>
<div style="padding-left:20pt;">?view=<i>sitename</i>/<i>pagename</i>&amp;type=<i>outputtype</i></div>
<br>
The saved page is recalculated before display unless there is a "&amp;recalc=no" argument.
The saved page is not modified by viewing it, even if a recalculation is done.
<br><br>
The values of cells may be temporarily changed before recalculation by using
a "cell" argument:
<br><br>
<div style="padding-left:20pt;">&amp;cell:<i>coord</i>:<i>type</i>=<i>value</i></div>
<br> 
"coord" is a cell coordinate, such as B7; "type" is "n" (numeric), "t" (text), or
"e:na" (error: NA value); and "value" is the value.
There may only be one cell argument for each coordinate.
The cell must have "Live View Modifiable" set to "yes"
(one of the Format Misc settings).
The modifications are not saved in the data file.
<br><br>
The logged in user may be logged out using the following argument:
<br><br>
<div style="padding-left:20pt;">?view=logout</div>

<b>BACKUPS HELP</b><br><br>
Whenever a page is published a backup copy of the data file used to create the rendered HTML page is saved.
The Tools Backups command is used to manage those files.
<br><br>
The Backups Command has three different lists that it can display:
the list of all existing backups for <b>one page</b>,
the list of information about backups for <b>all pages</b> in a site,
and the <b>details from a particular backup file</b> for a single page.
In addition there are Preference settings that control how many backup files are preserved.
<br><br>
There are three types of backup files: the "published" data file, normal backup files, and "archive" backup files.
All are stored in the same data directory on the system.
The published data files are the data files as they last were when edited before publishing.
They have a name in the format "pagename.published.txt".
The backup data files are copies of the published data files made each time a page is published
with a filename that reflects the time (GMT) when the page was published.
They have a name in the format "pagename.backup.year-month-day-hour-min-sec.txt".
<br><br>
Older backup files can be automatically deleted so that only a specified number of backup files are kept
(see Preferences below).
Any particular backup file, though, may be designated an "archive" backup file and may then only be deleted using
an explicit command.
The archive backup data files are in the same internal format as the backup data files and have
a name in the format "pagename.archive.year-month-day-hour-min-sec.txt".
<br><br>
<b>BACKUPS FOR ONE PAGE</b><br><br>
This is a list of all existing backup and archive files for a particular page.
For each file it lists the date/time published, the author (if known), the number
of entries in the page's edit log, the comments set for that particular publish time,
and the type of file (backup file, archive file, or current edit file not yet published).
<br><br>
The Edit button lets you open a particular backup file for edit.
Doing that will not replace the most recently published file until you publish it
so you can use this to just examine the old page.
However, opening it for edit will discard all edits currently made but unpublished to that particular page if
it is open for edit. Before discarding the edits a popup should warn you and wait for confirmation.
<br><br>
The Details button switches to the Details display for that data file.
That display has its own help text.
<br><br>
The Archive button turns a normal backup file into an archive file.
<br><br>
The Delete button lets you delete a particular backup or archive file.
It does NOT ask for confirmation.
<br><br>
<b>BACKUPS FOR ALL PAGES</b><br><br>
This is a list of pages on the site that have backups.
It is sorted in reverse chronological order by publish date/time.
For each line, there is the name of the page, the Full Name of the page (if available),
the date/time of the most recently created backup for that page in the group of
backup files represented by that line in the list, and the number of backup files in the group.
A new line in the listing appears whenever the next older backup is from a different page.
<br><br>
The List button next to the first instance of a page's name may be used to switch to the
Backups for One Page view of for that page.
<br><br>
<b>PREFERENCES</b><br><br>
You may specify the maximum number of backup files to keep for each page.
This setting applies to all pages on the current site.
<br><br>
You may also specify the minimum number of days to keep a file
(counting from the time when publishing is done)
to prevent a backup file from being deleted no matter what the Maximum Backup Files setting.
This will prevent a flurry of edits and publishes from prematurely deleting recent backups but can result in
the number of files in the data directory growing large.
<br><br>
By default, a site keeps all backup files.
Use the Preferences settings to change that behavior.
<br><br>

*** WKCtextdataname: backupdetailshelptext ***
<b>BACKUPS DETAILS HELP</b><br><br>
This is a display of detailed information from a single backup file.
It consists of the following:
<div style="padding:6pt 0px 0px 1em;">
<dl>
<dt>Site<dd>The full and short name for the site the page is on.
<dt>Backup Filename<dd>The name of this backup file.
<dt>Page<dd>The full and short name for the page as stored in this backup file.
(The full name may change over time due to edits using the Tools Page Preferences command.)
<dt>Last Author<dd>The author at the time of the last modification, if known.
<dt>Comments<dd>The comments set by the user before publishing, if any.
<dt>Started With File<dd>The date/time of the backup or archive file before this one in time.
<dt>Edits<dd>A list of the edit log which has lines representing most edits made to the page
during the time covered by this backup file.
The lines in the log represent "commands" executed in response to user operations
or comments preceded by "#" representing operations that are not fully described by commands.
For example, "set B5 value n 15" means "set cell B5 to the numeric value 15", and
"insertrow B31" means "insert a row above cell B31".

The rest of the arguments are passed to the URL as parameters "V1", "V2", etc.
The format they are passed is "Tvalue", where "T" is N (numeric), T (text), B (blank), or E (error).
The URL should return text in the form "Tvalue", where "T" is N, T, H (HTML text), or E (error followed by text)
<dt>wkcTEXT(value, value, ...)<dd>Returns the values as a single plain text value. Values may be cell references.
